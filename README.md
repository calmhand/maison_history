# Maison Margiela's History

This project was done to showcase topics I learning NMIX 4020. After taking the class, I have a better understanding
of HTML, CSS, and VueJS/Javascript. For this, I wanted to delve further into Vue so I used Vue CLI to create this project.
I used and linked multiple components and styles everything from the ground up along some styles from Bootstrap 5.

The simplicity of the site is due to my desire to match the style of Maison Margiela's look. This site will moreso focus
on the different technologies and techniques I learned from the course.

The glowing numbers are buttons that will display their meaning and be accompanied by a photo. All photos were retrieved from Google Images.
