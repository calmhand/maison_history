        "description" : "Parisian fashion house Maison Margiela has been a name to know for its sartorial excellence since its birth in 1988. The eponymous label was launched by Belgian designer Martin Margiela, whose creations in men’s and womenswear have pushed the boundaries of design with it’s deconstructing, reinventing and redefining of the male and female silhouette. Martin Margiela’s first taste of working in the fashion industry was in 1984 when he started working at Jean Paul Gaultier as a design assistant. Four years later and the Maison Margiela label launched into the luxury fashion market. Not fulfilled with the pressures of one label, Martin simultaneously becomes womenswear director at Hermes later in 1997.",
        "extra_info" : "Unique to each garment, Maison Margiela labels display a run of numbers from 0-23, corresponding to the collection it sits in. For example garments with number 4 circled sit in the mens collection, whereas garments with number 1 circled are part of the womenswear collection.",

        "description" : "The trend for larger-than-life designers and clothing was in full swing; contemporaries like Thierry Mugler and Christian Lacroix delivered ostentatious, bold designs and a burst of personality to match. Margiela, a Belgian living in Paris who’d studied alongside other forward-thinkers like Dries Van Noten and Ann Demeulemeester, sought to turn this trend on its head, eschewing almost all publicity for himself — he was famously described as “fashion’s invisible man” for his refusal to have his photograph taken and his habit of delivering most communication via fax — and often obscuring models’ faces to let the clothes speak for themselves. And what clothes they were; taking an avant-garde approach to design, Margiela’s garments were deconstructed and reconstructed again, with a particular emphasis on the colour white, utilising sharp tailoring and unconventional materials to present a uniquely future-facing aesthetic.",
